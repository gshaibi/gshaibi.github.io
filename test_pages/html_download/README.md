## Overview
This repo contains the sources files of a demo that displays the behavior of the `download` attribute for hyperlinks.

These files are a component of a Six Revisions guide called [HTML5 Download Attribute Guide](http://sixrevisions.com/html5/download-attribute/).

## Details
The source files include a `download` attribute feature-detection script written in jQuery that will display a responsive modal window with a message warning the user that the browser being used doesn't implement the attribute if it fails to be detected by the script.

- `/css/stylesheet.css` — page-aesthetic style rules and the required CSS for the responsive modal window
- `/js/script.js` — contains mildly-documented jQuery code that will detect whether or not the `download` attribute is present in the current browser, as well as the logic for opening and closing the responsive modal window
- `/samp/htmldoc.html` — a sample HTML document for testing purposes
- `html5download-demo.html` — the demo page
